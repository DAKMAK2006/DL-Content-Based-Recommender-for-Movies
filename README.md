# DL-Content-Based-Recommender-for-Movies
This is a Content-Based Movie Recommender using a custom dual-tower Deep Neural Network (DNN) in Keras/TensorFlow. The dual-tower architecture processes 14 user and 16 item features into 32-unit L2-normalized vectors, enabling rating prediction via a dot product and efficient item similarity searches on the MovieLens dataset.
